    <div class="basic ve" id="list1a">
      <a class="head">Terminal</a>
			<div>
        <p>Terminal is the base module that supports essential terminal operation.  The Rail and Vessel modules use Terminal Gate functions in their process flows.  Terminal includes the Yard Planning feature as well as other additional feature listed below.  Many Terminal features are available on handheld devices, as well as on the desktop, to enhance productivity.</p>


  <h1>Features of the Terminal Module</h1>
  <p><span>Gate</span><br />Receive	Assigns bay location using parking algorithm.  Sets units to in-inventory status and sends arrival message to trading partners.<br />
Truck Load List	Facilitates creation of truck loads.  Haulaway carriers may create truck loads in VinTelligent via EDI messages.<br />
Dispatch	Removes units from inventory and sends shipped message to trading partners.  Units may be dispatched singly or by Truck Load List.</p>

  <p><span>Inventory Management</span><br />Inspection	Records results of inspections.  Tracks inspections by type, such as “Receipt Inspection”.<br />
Holds and Releases	Records user-defined hold codes and subsequent releases.  Supports multiple concurrent holds.  Sends hold and release messages to trading partners and accepts holds and releases from trading partners via EDI.<br />
Physical Inventory	Supports physical inventory and reconciliation for all or part of the yard.  Self-reconciles as events are recorded.<br />
Rebay	Assigns bay locations using the parking algorithm for yard moves. Sends yard move message to trading partners.</p>

  <p><span>ASN Management</span><br />Routing and handling are directed by Advance Shipping Instructions (ASNs) typically received via EDI. VinTelligent also supports manual update of shipping instructions, either by individual ASN or in groups, and ASN reporting.</p>

<p><span>Yard Planning</span><br />Yard Planning is a powerful tool that is used to assign the best open yard space to a unit.  The parking algorithm is based on flexible user-defined rules and supports assignment of units to single vehicle bays, multiple vehicle bays and load lanes.  It enforces all restrictions set for the actual yard location such as the maximum number of vehicles in a bay and the bay status (active / inactive).	</p>

<p><span>General</span><br />Events and Statuses	Enforces business rules regarding status changes. All events and status changes are recorded and may be viewed on the activity log.<br />
Reports		ASN,  inventory, activities, status, inspection, yard capacity and other reports are provided.</p>

<h1>Additional Features</h1>
   <p><span>Dashboard </span> - The dashboard provides a one-page management snapshot of ongoing terminal activity.</p>
   <p><span>VinInsight </span> - VinInsight is the tool that allow operators to give their customers direct access to reports on their own data. </p>
   <p><span>Security </span> - Role-base security configures user access as appropriate for each job function.</p>
   <p><span>Archive </span> - Maintains high performance of active operations by archiving completed transactions at user-defined intervals.  Data is viewable on archive reports</p>
   <p><span>Message Center </span> - Message Center is the control center for the monitoring and managing EDI messages.</p>
      </div>

			<div>
       <p>The VinTelligent Rail Module, in conjunction with the <span class="undr_l">Terminal</span> module, provides comprehensive support for rail ramp operations.  Yard Planning enables definition of parking logic to meet specific needs such baying by dealer area to facilitate truck loading or in load lanes to speed up railcar loading.  Many rail features are available on handheld devices, as well as on the desktop, and may be used on the yard and at the track. Fixed scanners may be used to optimize receipt of vehicles through the plant gate.</p>

  <h1>Features of the Rail Module</h1>
  <p><span>Railcar Management </span><br />Spotting	Records railcar track location and condition (empty, loaded, bad order).<br />
Ready To Pull	Sends a message to the railroad that the cars are ready to pull.<br />
Releasing 	Removes railcar from the track and sends shipped messages for units loaded in railcars.<br />
Track Sheet	Displays current status of all railcars at ramp.</p>

  <p><span>Inbound Flow</span><br />Bay Assignment	Automated bay assignment speeds unloading of railcars by pre-assigning bays and generating bar-coded bay tickets.<br />
Grounding	Sets units to in-inventory status and sends arrival messages to trading partners.<br />
Reconciliation	Report identifies discrepancies between the units planned for grounding and those actually grounded.<br />
Truck Load List	Facilitates creation of truck loads.  Haulaway carriers may create truck loads in VinTelligent via EDI messages. <span class="italic">(Terminal Module)</span><br />
Gate Dispatch	Removes units from inventory and sends shipped message to trading partners.  Units may be dispatched singly or by Truck Load List. <span class="italic">(Terminal Module)</span></p>

  <p><span>Outbound Flow</span><br />Gate Receive	Assigns bay location using parking algorithm.  Sets received units to-in inventory status and sends arrival message to trading partners. <span class="italic">(Terminal Module)</span><br />
Load Planning	Plans railcar loads. Sets up railcar strings for automated loading.<br />
Rail Loading	Automated loading scans units as they are driven up the buck ramp and automatically records railcar, deck and position for each unit. Manual loading allows user to specify railcar, deck and position.  Both options send loaded status messages to trading partners<br />
Reconciliation	Report identifies discrepancies between the load plan and the actual load.</p>

  <p><span>General</span><br />Events &amp; Statuses	Enforces business rules regarding status changes. All events and status changes are recorded and may be viewed on the activity log.<br />
Reports	Specific reports provide details on railcar activities and statuses. Rail Load Planning Reports provide basis for railcar allocation by destination</p>

      </div>
      <a class="head">Vessel</a>
			<div>
          <p>The VinTelligent Vessel Module, in conjunction with the <span class="undr_l">Terminal</span> module, provides comprehensive support for marine terminal operations including handling of vehicles and unitized cargo, such as pallets and bundles. Yard Planning, enables definition of parking logic to meet specific needs such baying by discharge port to speed up vessel loading.  Many vessel features are available on handheld devices, as well as on the desktop, and may be used on the yard and at the dock. Fixed scanners may be used to optimize receipt of vehicles through a plant gate.</p>
